Ex 1:

Why we used Random Search for Public key e in RSA:

We use random search instead of a deterministic for-loop 
to find the public key e because it provides better
 cryptographic security and unpredictability. While a
  for-loop starting from a fixed value (3, 5, 7...)
   would quickly find a valid e, it makes the key generation
    process predictable, attackers could guess likely values 
    of e based on common patterns. Random selection ensures 
    that each key pair has a unique, unpredictable public key,
     enhancing security. Additionally, since the 
     probability of finding a coprime to φ(n) is very high, the expected number 
     of iterations is small (typically 1-3 attempts), making random 
     search both secure and efficient. This approach balances
      cryptographic strength with computational practicality,
       ensuring that RSA keys remain resistant to pattern-based attacks.



Because rsa works inly with integers, to encrypt a msg, we convert each character to its unicode.

In ex 2, we need two prime numbers of 512 bit to get a key of 1024 buts ...

ex 3 -4

We shoudl create once the key pair and use them each time becuase the e is generated using randomness
Therefore we might not get the same key pair each time
ex4

    print("\nStep 1: Decrypt using my private key to get the message signed by recipient.")
    print("Note: We should do the steps in this order because when a person sends a message, they first sign it with their private key and then encrypt it with the recipient's public key.")
